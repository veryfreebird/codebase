* Example for simple transport mode in v4/v6
--------------------------------------------

with different combinations of Authentication and Encryption Algorithms 

Encryption :
------------
TripleDES-CBC [RFC2451]
AES-CBC with 128-bit keys [RFC3602]
DES-CBC [RFC2405]
NULL Encryption

Authentication:
---------------
HMAC-MD5-96 [RFC2403]
HMAC-SHA1-96 [RFC2404]
Null Authentication

It contains : 

- a capture file : capture.pcap

- Some preferences files with the configurations for v4 and v6
  that you have to put in ~/.ethereal/preferences. 
  Because you only may set 5 SAs, I had to get several configurations
  files:

        - preferences_v4_(i)
        - preferences_v6_(i)

- The sad has been run using : ipsec.conf (config file for setkey)

Update:

- The ESP SA settings are nowadays stored as user accessible table
  in the file `esp_sa`. The settings from the original preferences
  have been converted to the new format and are kept for historical
  reasons only.
