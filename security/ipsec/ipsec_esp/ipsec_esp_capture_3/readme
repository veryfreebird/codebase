* Some more Encryption Algorithms with Authentication checking
--------------------------------------------------------------

Exemple of decryption of both Algorithms :

BLOWFISH-CBC [RFC2451] with key size of 128 bits
TWOFISH-CBC with key size of 128 and 256 bits


It contains : 

- a capture file : capture.pcap

- A preference file with the configuration 
  that you have to put in ~/.ethereal/preferences

        - preferences    	

- The sad has been run using : ipsec.conf (config file for setkey)


Update:

- The ESP SA settings are nowadays stored as user accessible table
  in the file `esp_sa`. The settings from the original preferences
  have been converted to the new format and are kept for historical
  reasons only.
