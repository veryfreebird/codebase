* Example for tunnel mode in v4 and authentication checking
-----------------------------------------------------------

The topology used was the following:

                                             DUMP
 N1                         SGW1               |        N2
[192.168.0.3] -------[192.168.0.2][10.0.0.1]--------[10.0.0.2]

default route for 192.168.0.3 is 192.168.0.2
There is not default route on 10.0.0.2.
it means that I will received destination unreachable ... Great  ;-) 

In this case I have the following policies:

########## For 192.168.0.2 (SGW1)
spdadd  192.168.0.3 10.0.0.2 any -P out ipsec
esp/tunnel/10.0.0.1-10.0.0.2/use;
add 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 esp 10
-m tunnel
-E aes-cbc "aescbcencryption"
-A hmac-sha1 "hmacsha1authenticati";

########## For 192.168.0.3 (N1)
spdadd  192.168.0.3 10.0.0.2 any -P out ipsec esp/transport//require;
add 192.168.0.3 10.0.0.2 esp 15
-E des-cbc "descbte"
-A hmac-sha1 "hmacsha1authenticati";

It means that packets coming from N1 to N2 will be encrypted with
des-cbc and tunneled with ESP encryption aes-cbc to N2.
If I have a look at the DUMP host, I have these two SAs to decrypt the entire packet.
I will have something like

[IP1][ESP1][ENCRYPTION1]

with [ENCRYPTION1]=[IP2][ESP2][ENCRYPTION2]
and [ENCRYPTION2]=ICMP

IP1 is ip layer from SGW1 to N2
ENCRYPTION2 is aes-cbc
IP2 is ip layer from N1 to N2
ENCRYPTION2 is des-cbc

thus you have enough information to describe the whole packet.
if you use the preference File in attachment it will do this.
You only have two SAs :

SA #1: IPV4|10.0.0.1|10.0.0.2|*
Encrypt 1 : AES-CBC
Auth 1 : HMAC-SHA1
Encrypt Key 1 : aescbcencryption

SA #2: IPV4|192.168.0.3|10.0.0.2|*
Encrypt 2 : DES-CBC
Auth 2 : HMAC-SHA1
Encrypt Key 2 : descbcte


Update:

- The ESP SA settings are nowadays stored as user accessible table
  in the file `esp_sa`. The settings from the original preferences
  have been converted to the new format and are kept for historical
  reasons only.
