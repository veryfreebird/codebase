OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol formerly known as the
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The protocol implementation is based
on a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library, which can also
be used stand-alone.
OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.
The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org].

Overview
The OpenSSL toolkit includes:
- libssl
an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446]).
- libcrypto
a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
- openssl
the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
testing and analyzing. It can be used for
o creation of key parameters
o creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
o calculation of message digests
o encryption and decryption
o SSL/TLS client and server tests
o handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
o and more...
Download
For Production Use
Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
www.openssl.org/source.
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.
However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.
For Testing and Development
Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.
The official OpenSSL Git Repository is located at [git.openssl.org].
There is a GitHub mirror of the repository at [github.com/openssl/openssl],
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.
A local copy of the Git Repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the original OpenSSL repository using
git clone git://git.openssl.org/openssl.git
or from the GitHub mirror using
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git
If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the OpenSSL repository openssl/openssl on
GitHub and clone your public fork instead.
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git
This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see Contributing.
Build and Install
After obtaining the Source, have a look at the INSTALL file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.
* Notes for UNIX-like platforms
* Notes for Android platforms
* Notes for Windows platforms
* Notes for the DOS platform with DJGPP
* Notes for the OpenVMS platform
* Notes on Perl
* Notes on Valgrind
Specific notes on upgrading to OpenSSL 3.0 from previous versions can be found
in the [migration_guide(7ossl)] manual page.

Manual Pages
The manual pages for the master branch and all current stable releases are
available online.
- OpenSSL master
- OpenSSL 3.0
- OpenSSL 1.1.1
Wiki
There is a Wiki at [wiki.openssl.org] which is currently not very active.
It contains a lot of useful information, not all of which is up-to-date.
License
OpenSSL is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which means that
you are free to get and use it for commercial and non-commercial
purposes as long as you fulfill its conditions.
See the LICENSE.txt file for more details.
Support
There are various ways to get in touch. The correct channel depends on
your requirement. See the SUPPORT file for more details.
Contributing
If you are interested and willing to contribute to the OpenSSL project,
please take a look at the CONTRIBUTING file.
Legalities
A number of nations restrict the use or export of cryptography. If you are
potentially subject to such restrictions, you should seek legal advice before
attempting to develop or distribute cryptographic code.
